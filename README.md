# html-reduce

The **html-reduce** [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) package provides a single function that boils down HTML to the simplest, obviously opinionated, form. The initial use case of **html-reduce** is normalizing [RSS item-level descriptions](http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/encodingDescriptions.html) and [atom:summary elemetns](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.13) in such way that a na√Øve client can render homogeneous output.
